## Folder Structure Division

The project's folder structure is using Clean Architecture MVVM Pattern which divided into distinct sections to separate their respective roles:

1. **Data:**
    - Location to access data sources such as local storage, network, or other data providers.
    - Example: `data/local`, `data/remote`.

2. **Domain:**
    - Contains business logic related to task management.
    - This is where business rules concerning tasks and related logic are defined.
    - Example: `domain/model`, `domain/repository`.

3. **Presentation:**
    - Used for the user interface.
    - Activities, fragments, layouts, and UI-related classes are placed here.
    - Example: `presentation/screens`, `presentation/adapters`.

Ensure compliance with this folder structure to facilitate development, maintenance, and team collaboration.
